# Brain Tumor Classification using Hybrid Deep Learning Models

A powerful deep learning project that classifies brain MRI images into tumor and non-tumor categories using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and hybrid ML models.  
Built to support clinical insights and automate early tumor detection with **95% accuracy**.

> Developed by **Venkatesh P** as part of an academic research initiative under **RUSA â€“ University of Madras**.

## Overview

This project focuses on classifying MRI brain images into four categories:
- **Glioma Tumor**
- **Meningioma Tumor**
- **Pituitary Tumor**
- **No Tumor**

It uses **TensorFlow CNN** for image feature extraction and **XGBoost / Random Forest** for enhanced prediction accuracy.  
The hybrid architecture combines the strengths of both deep learning and traditional machine learning to achieve better interpretability and generalization.

## Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Image resizing, normalization, and augmentation (flip, rotate, color jitter)  
2. **Model Design**  
   - CNN (ResNet18-based) for feature extraction  
   - Features fed into ML classifiers (SVM, RF, XGBoost)  
3. **Training and Validation**  
   - 80/20 train-test split  
   - Adam optimizer and cross-entropy loss  
4. **Evaluation**  
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix
